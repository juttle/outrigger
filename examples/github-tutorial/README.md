# Juttle Tutorial: GitHub Dataset

The *.juttle files here are Juttle programs that work with GitHub events dataset:

- github_data_sample.json (small subset of the data)
- github_data.json (full 30MB dataset, provided as zip archive)
- github_metadata.csv (additional metadata file in CSV format)

The programs assume that you have copied the data file to `/tmp/data.json` location.

The tutorial that walks you through setup steps and execution of Juttle programs is published
[here](http://juttle.github.io/juttle/concepts/juttle_tutorial/)
and maintained on GitHub in the main [juttle repository](https://github.com/juttle/juttle/blob/master/docs/concepts/juttle_tutorial.md).
